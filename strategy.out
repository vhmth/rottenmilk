1. Defensive Energy
    - Stay near our goal.
    - Position our bot between opponent and ball to intercept their kicks.
    - If we block a ball, kick it away from our opponent.
        * Kick it towards their goal if they are on one side.
        * Kick it towards the far side so that it'll bounce into
          their goal if they are in the middle.
    - While not blocking, solve as many sudoku puzzels as we can.
